Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student at [Harvard Astronomy](https://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu/) advised by [Prof. Charlie Conroy](https://scholar.harvard.edu/cconroy). My thesis is focused on identifying and understanding the immigrant galaxies the Milky Way has assimilated throughout its history (*Galactic Archaeology*) using the [H3 Survey](http://h3survey.rc.fas.harvard.edu/) and the [Gaia](https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia) satellite. I also work on the origins of the very first galaxies (*Cosmic Dawn*) and how/when they ionized the Universe (*Cosmic Reionization*) with my undergrad thesis adviser [Prof. Pascal Oesch](https://obswww.unige.ch/~oeschp/).

I grew up in Hyderabad, India (for a recent review, [see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWNV82AqFoE)). In a Bollywood-esque plot twist, at age 18 I dropped out of engineering school, took my first-ever plane-ride, and joined the first graduating class of 150 students at [Yale-NUS College](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/), Singapore (["Asia's first liberal arts college"](https://harvardmagazine.com/2017/07/an-educated-core)). Amidst my [many](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/10-may-2016-a-love-affair-with-trivia/) [Yale-NUS](https://www.instagram.com/yalenuscollege/p/BK5xNvcj6u6/?hl=en) [adventures](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/20-may-2015-singaporean-poet-alvin-pang-teaches-at-yale-nus/), I discovered the joys of Astronomy working with [Prof. Charles Bailyn](http://www.astro.yale.edu/bailyn/), and as an exchange student with [Dr. Iva Momcheva](https://www.stsci.edu/~imomcheva/) in the [van Dokkum](https://www.pietervandokkum.com/) group at Yale.
